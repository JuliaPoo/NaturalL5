## Installing

```bash
npm install
```

## Developing

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

## To run without the editor/console

Replace the containers in `+page.svelte` with just the `Form` container. Ideally this should also just be an argument toggle of some sort.
