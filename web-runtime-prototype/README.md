# Evaluation Form Prototype

This folder implements the DSL for the forward evaluator. `index.ts` contains sample code to interact with the evaluator. Apologies for the complete lack of documentation.

## Running the evaluator

```
npm run start:dev
```

This will automatically run `index.ts` once the `src` folder is modified.
